# Mermaid Reshuffle
Reshuffler for mermaid diagrams

Don't you find tiresome when you realize you have to build a whole subgraph in mermaid but... you have to move around the other subgraphs and substitute **every single occurence** for all of them?

Don't to mention this process is prone to errors. So, in case you organize mermaid diagrams like me (alphabet letters + digits) this script could help you! Just do

```
git clone https://github.com/DeadLockStarve/mermaid_reshuffle.git
cd mermaid_reshuffle
git install .
```
